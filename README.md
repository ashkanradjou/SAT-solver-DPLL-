# SAT-solver-DPLL-

The purpose of this report is to provide an overview and description of the SAT solver code implemented in Python using the DPLL (Davis–Putnam–Logemann–Loveland) algorithm.
The purpose of the SAT solver is to determine whether the given CNF formula (linked normal form) is satisfied and if it is, it provides an assignment to the variables.
